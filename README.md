== README

This is a copy of the Bloccitoff assignment in the Full-Stack course at Bloc.io. The goal is to build a todo list that destroys to-dos after 7 days. This is my attempt to try Test-Driven Development methods for the first time. 

* It is being built in Ruby  2.0.0p451 (2014-02-24 revision 45167) [x86_64-darwin12.5.0]

* Rspec with Capybara are part of the test suite
